<p>You might be wondering how to adopt Scala into your existing team. The good news is that you don’t need to wait for that greenfield project to start. With a bit of planning, you can integrate Scala into your existing Java projects.</p>

<p>In this part of the book, I’ll report on some of my experiences moving existing Java projects to Scala. We’ll talk about what you can expect if you try to do so. I’ll outline a typical learning curve and give you one or two things to look out for, some concrete things you should be doing, and what you should be avoiding.</p>
