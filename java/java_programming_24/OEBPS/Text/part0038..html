    <section>
        <p>Technical <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="551" id="Page_551"></span>job interviewing is a game with
            well-defined rules. I’ve worn the hats of both interviewer and interviewee many times over my Java career.
            In this lesson I share with you my views on hiring Java developers and on preparing for technical
            interviews.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether the IT job market is hot or not at any given time, there are some rules and techniques
            that can increase your interview success rate. The process of getting a job consists of three separate
            activities:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Getting the interview</li>
            <li>Interviewing successfully</li>
            <li>Considering the offer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I can’t stress enough how important it is to work on each of these tasks <i>separately</i>, one step at a
            time! Let’s discuss them one by one.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2><a id="getting_the_interview"></a>Getting the Interview</h2>
        <p>Your résumé is the most <a id="tech"></a>important thing in the first step. Unless you are a well-known Java
            guru (if you were, you wouldn’t read this book) your résumé is your main weapon for getting an
            interview. Adjust the résumé for each position you are applying for. No, I’m not asking you to lie, but you
            have to highlight your skills that match each particular job opening you’re applying to. Make sure it’s
            short and to the point (not more than two pages long).</p>
        <p>If you are applying for a Java developer’s position, nobody needs to know the details of that Visual Basic
            project from 10 years ago. Always update your résumé based on the feedback you receive from recruiters or
            more experienced programmers.</p>
        <p>There is a summary section on each résumé, and many people waste this space with some junk like, “I’m looking
            for a challenging position that will let me improve my talents.” What a waste! Use this summary line to show
            your relevant skills.</p>
        <p>Say <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="552" id="Page_552"></span>you’ve been specializing in Java messaging
            during the last two years, but this job posting requires web developers. Add a phrase that the messaging
            architecture was able to support both Java and web clients.  Recruiters are not too technical—they do a
            quick résumé scan to find the presence of the required keywords. Also, chances are that you’ve developed web
            applications before; highlight your web experience in the summary section of your résumé. The same day you
            may be responding to another ad seeking people who know Java messaging.</p>
        <p>Modify your summary section accordingly and send a version of your résumé that emphasizes your experience
            with messaging; your understanding of the web principle is not that important here.</p>
        <p>Job requirements are more involved these days, and recruiting companies don’t even want to submit your résumé
            to the client if you have “only” 8 out of 10 required skills. Read the requirements and highlight all the
            relevant skills you have. Do not be lazy; work with your résumé.</p>
        <p>Networking is another great way to get an interview. This time I’m not talking about Java networking; I’m
            talking about meeting other IT people who may be hiring or know people who are hiring. Attend your local
            Java Users Group meetings, join online <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetups</a>, follow Java developers
            on Twitter, and go to professional conferences and seminars.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2><a id="doing_well_at_the_interview"></a>Doing Well at the Interview</h2>
        <p>OK. The interview is scheduled, and now your main goal is to ace it. Remember, your interviewer has a
            difficult task: He needs to assess your technical skills within 30 to 60 minutes, so help him! In advance of
            the interview, try to get as many technical details about the job as possible from your recruiter. If the
            position you are applying for requires knowledge of Java sockets, research working with non-blocking
            sockets. If the company is building Java EE applications, find out which application server they use and
            read up on it.</p>
        <p>Do your homework and<i> prepare a short talk</i> about some interesting and challenging technical problems
            you might have experienced in one of your college or real-world projects. If you didn’t have any
            super-complex projects, just pick up a topic from one of the multiple online programmers’ forums and
            research it. Another great source of Java tips and tricks is a hugely popular online resource called
            Stackoverlow. This is a place where software developers ask and answer questions about different programming
            languages and technologies. Check out <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/java">the Java
                section</a> at Stackoverflow.</p>
        <p>For example, if you have prepared a talk on concurrent collections, you’re not allowed to leave the interview
            without talking about this. But what if the interviewer won’t ask you about Java concurrency? It doesn’t
            really matter. Find a way to switch the conversation to the prepared topic and do your best. The interviewer
            will be happy because he doesn’t need to think about what to ask next, and you’re happy because you’ve had a
            chance to talk about a well-prepared subject.</p>
        <p>Will this technique work all the time? No. But it’ll work most of the time. Obviously you need to research
            the selected subject well, or you’ll get burned. You must talk about technical challenges you’ve resolved.
            You need to remember that your interviewers face a challenging task of figuring out your technical abilities
            in just 30 minutes. So, you need to help them out. Be in charge.</p>
        <p>If you’re a junior developer, spend some time answering the multiple-choice computer tests that are usually
            required for certification exams. You don’t need to get certified, but all these books and online mock tests
            will help you pass similar tests offered by some job agencies. Find some sample interview questions
            online.</p>
        <p>A <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="553" id="Page_553"></span>technical interview is a game with known
            rules, but in many cases the interviewers are not prepared to run the interviews. Sometimes they just go by
            a prepared list of questions. Some interviewees take advantage of this and just spend some time studying
            introductory courses, and then memorize questions and answers for technical interviews. Believe it or not,
            in many cases this works.</p>
        <p>What does a good enterprise Java developer have to know in addition to understanding the difference between
            abstract classes and interfaces? Usually employers are looking for people with knowledge of the following:
            Java Servlets, JSP, Spring framework, JMS, any commercial message-oriented middleware, JDBC, JNDI, HTML,
            XML, Hibernate, build tools, SQL, one of the major application servers, and a couple of relational database
            management systems.</p>
        <p>Understanding why a particular Java EE component is being used in your current project is equally important.
            If the interviewer asks you, “Why did you use EJB in this project?” please do not answer, “That decision was
            made before I joined the project.” Even if it was, have your own opinion and explain why you think it was a
            good or bad choice for this particular project.</p>
        <p>Here’s another tip: Don’t critique the application architecture of your potential employer. You’ll have
            plenty of chances to provide technical advice if you’re hired, so just focus on getting an offer. Remember,
            one step at a time!</p>
        <p>Be energetic during the interview and show your interest in the job. Even if you are a technical guru, don’t
            behave as if you’re doing the interviewer a favor just by showing up. Personality matters. People don’t like
            prima donnas.</p>
        <p>Be prepared to write code on a whiteboard and practice that skill. The interviewer may not ask you to do
            this, but it may be a good idea to start illustrating your thoughts on the board if there is one in the
            room. If there is no board, use your own notepad. Often interviewers are trying to judge how well you think
            and approach a problem more than how effectively you’ve memorized an algorithm, class name, or method
            arguments.</p>
        <p>No need to rush. If you start writing a code fragment on a board, don’t be afraid of making mistakes. Think
            aloud. It may be even beneficial for the interviewer to see how you can identify the wrong approach and then
            pick the right one. Practice explaining little code fragments to your friends or relatives; they don’t need
            to know Java to participate in these role-playing games.</p>
        <p>Questions of data structures and collections are pretty popular during the interviews. For example, you need
            to be able to explain when using  <code>LinkedList</code> is better than using <code>ArrayList</code>. Some
            people fail the interview on simple task like “write a program to reverse letters in a word.” Get a book on
            data structures and algorithms and skim through it before going to the interview.</p>
        <p>After the interview, as soon as you leave the building, take notes about what just happened. Don’t postpone
            it until you get home; you may forget important details. Make a note to work on the questions you might have
            not answered correctly. These questions require your attention <a id="idp23988768"></a>and research. Improve
            your technical skills after each interview.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2><a id="considering_the_offer"></a>Considering the Offer</h2>
        <p>You’ve got an offer! Now think <a id="idp23981824"></a>hard about whether you want to accept it. Have I
            mentioned that you should look for a new job not when your employer decides to let you go or your contract
            ends, but when you have a stable job, the sky is blue, and the grass is green? This gives you a tremendous
            advantage: You can consider the offer without being under pressure from unpaid bills.</p>
        <p>Don’t <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="554" id="Page_554"></span>accept an offer just because the new job
            pays an extra $5,000 a year, which comes to less than $300 a month after taxes. Do accept the offer that
            gives you a chance to work with interesting technologies or business applications even if it won’t pay you
            an extra dime.</p>
        <p>Other nonmonetary factors of an offer are health benefits, flexible work hours, ease of commute, or simply a
            kinship that you feel with the people working for the potential employer. Believe it or not, <a
                    id="idp23991152"></a>some people won’t accept offers from employers who require you to wear suit and
            tie. Just make a decision about what’s more important for you—having an interesting job or being able to
            show off your latest tattoos.</p>
        <p>No matter what your preferences are, take charge of your career and actively build it the way you want.</p>

        <h2><a id="interviewing_enterprise_developers"></a>Interviewing Enterprise Developers</h2>
        <p>When the job market is <a id="idp23992960"></a><a id="idp23994096"></a>healthy, major online job search
            engines show thousands of openings, and people are competing for these jobs. These days a seasoned developer
            has to know about 10 different tools or technologies to find a good job and feel relatively secure for a
            couple of years. Over the last several years I’ve interviewed lots of Java developers, and this is what I’ve
            noticed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People do not call themselves Java developers or programmer-analysts anymore; most of them prefer the
                title <i>Java architect</i>. Unfortunately, only some of them really understand how Java EE components
                operate and can suggest design solutions. Of course, knowledge of Java EE is not all that a Java
                architect should know.
            </li>
            <li>Job applicants are more senior, and I barely see any college graduates or junior programmers. Many of
                the junior positions are being outsourced and the number of graduates with computer science degrees has
                declined over the past several years.
            </li>
            <li>Having software certification does not make a résumé stand out. Actually, if a résumé starts with a list
                of certifications, most likely it’s a beginner’s. I’m not against certifications, as they help you learn
                a language or a tool, and show that you are willing to and can study. But a certificate doesn’t make
                someone a skilled professional.
            </li>
            <li>With the introduction of middle-tier object-relational mapping frameworks such as Hibernate, many people
                don’t even bother learning how database management systems work or how to write a SQL query that
                performs well — they just map Java classes to database tables.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On multiple occasions <a href="http://yakovfain.com/2012/10/11/the-degradation-of-java-developers/">I’ve
                    interviewed</a> enterprise Java developers who were trained to use certain frameworks, but without
                    understanding how things work under the hood. A simple question to explain in details what happens
                    between the moments when the user click the button Get Data on a web page and when the data arrive
                    often results in a description of how a certain web framework does it. But what if there is no
                    frameworks, but just a web page and a servlet. Not many programmers can describe such a data flow.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; line-height: 1.3em;">In a slow economy, be prepared to pass at least four interviews to get hired. Back in 1999 two good interviews would be enough; in 2001 it was very difficult to even get an interview, let alone a job!</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Today large portions of development is done in India. Even though the total cost of development is not
                low despite the lower hourly rates of offshore developers, Western hiring managers unfortunately have an
                impression that local candidates must be flexible in their rates, too. Being a native English speaker is
                not enough for you to charge top dollar. Always be technically current, otherwise the more motivated
                guys from overseas will leave you in the dust.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="555" id="Page_555"></span>knowledge of the business terminology of
            your potential employer is also important. I’m not sure about the Silicon Valley or Europe, but here in New
            York just being a techie may not be good enough to get you a senior job. Of course, interviewing with Google
            or Microsoft is an exception.</p>
        <p>For example, if you’re applying for a Java position in a financial brokerage company and don’t know what a
            short sale is, this may be a deal breaker. If you are a senior developer you should be able to hit the
            ground running: Try to find out from your recruiter as many details as possible about the business. Do your
            homework, and you’ll get the job! Recruiters are desperately looking for good programmers, and you can be
            one of them.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2><a id="to_get_or_not_to_get_certifiedquestion_m"></a>To Get or Not to Get Certified?</h2>
        <p>Any certification <a id="idp24014864"></a>program is a business for the vendor that wants to sell training to
            award certificates. Oracle is no exception; you can find various certification programs to rate your Java
            skills. The following website offers various certification programs in Java SE and EE technologies: <code><a
                    href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=651#5">http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=651#5</a></code>.
        </p>
        <p>Although most certification programs require you to pass a multiple-choice computer test, some of them (such
            as those for Java EE architects) give you a challenging task to design and program.</p>
        <p>Overall I think it’s a good idea to prepare yourself and go through the certification process because it will
            definitely improve your understanding of the Java language or a specific enterprise technology or framework.
            In some areas it may also improve the perception of your résumé. It’ll also help you slip through computer
            screening tests that are used by job placement agencies. Just check job postings from your potential
            employers to see if they insist on having certificates.</p>
        <p>I also want to caution you against overestimating the importance of getting Java certification. When I see a
            résumé that starts with a list of certificates, it tells me that this candidate is good... at passing
            multiple-choice tests. Having practical hands-on experience working on open-source or enterprise projects is
            a lot more valuable than any certificate you might have earned. It’s fine if you have certificates, but keep
            them somewhere at the end of your résumé rather than trying to present them as a major achievement.</p>

        <h2><a id="technical_questions_and_answers"></a>Technical Questions and Answers</h2>
        <p>Suggesting a list of technical <a id="qa"></a>questions for an interview is a risky business. Seasoned Java
            developers have different views on what’s fair and what’s not fair to ask. But junior developers who just
            completed a Java tutorial can definitely benefit from some guidance in preparing for Java job interviews.
        </p>
        <p>The following are suggested technical interview questions and expected brief answers on various Java-related
            topics. The questions included in this section are those that I had to answer while working on various
            projects. In no way is this a complete list of possible questions, but it definitely gives you an idea of
            what to expect at an interview. Most of the answers to these questions can be found in this book, but some
            require additional research.</p>

                <div class="line"><p>Prior to Java 8 I’d answered that an abstract class may contain code in method
                    bodies, which is not allowed in an interface. But with introduction of the defender and static

                                                                  id="Page_556"></span>be different. Abstract classes
                    can implement state in member variables, but interfaces can’t.  You can extend from one abstract
                    class, but implement multiple interfaces.With abstract classes you have to inherit your class from
                    the abstract one because Java does not allow multiple inheritance. </p></div>

                you should initialize only those variables that are allowed to have the same value for each user’s

            <p><span class="speaker"><span class="codeLabel"><b>A:</b></span></span></p>
            <div class="line"><p>In most cases arrays are faster. An array can be used if you know in advance the number
                of elements in the array. <code>ArrayList</code> is an API on top of an array. You do not need to know
                its size in advance; new elements can be added as needed. Arrays work faster because JVM allocates
                memory only once for all elements. But to give you a better answer I’d have to write an appropriate
                benchmark in context to find out.</p></div>

            <div class="line"><p>Reflection is a way of finding information about a Java class internals during run
                time. For example, you can find out the constructors and the method signatures of a particular class.
                The class <code>Class</code> has such methods as <code>getConstructor()</code>, <code>getFields()</code>,
                <code>getMethods()</code>, and others.</p></div>

            <p>I’d try to increase the size of the JVM’s dynamic memory (heap) on program start-up using command-line
                parameters. For example, you can request the minimum heap size of 512 MB and the maximum heap size of
                1024 MB as follows:</p>

            <div class="line"><p>You need to implement the singleton design pattern. Create a class with a private

        <h2><a id="epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h2>
        <p>The book is over. Even though it’s rather small in size for the number of the covered subjects, I tried to
            touch on a wide spectrum of topics that most Java practitioners have to know. You may still need to do
            additional research on certain subjects, depending on your project needs, but at least now you know where to
            dig.</p>
        <p>I really hope that you’ll keep this book handy as a quick reference or for a refresher when it’s time to
            start a new Java project or hit the job market. No matter what your motivation is, have fun reading. I
            certainly had fun writing it. You can send comments and suggestions via e-mail to
            <code>yakovfain@gmail.com</code>. Thank you for reading my book!</p>
