        <p> So <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="335" id="Page_335"></span>far most of the Java programs <a
                id="idp19787392"></a><a id="idp19788816"></a>in this tutorial have been running in a single Java virtual
            machine (JVM). There were two exceptions: In <a href="part0017.html">Lesson 16</a> in the section on <a
                    href="part0017.html#socket_programming">“Socket Programming”</a> you used two JVMs, and your JDBC
            programs from <a href="part0022.html#working_with_databases_using_jdbc">Chapter 21</a> communicated with
            another JVM running a database server. The application running on the user’s computer isn’t always allowed
            to access remote data directly—that’s one of the reasons <i>distributed Java applications</i> came <a
                    id="idp19791568"></a><a id="idp19794000"></a>into the picture. (The word distributed means having
            parts of the applications running on several computers.) The other reason was to provide a centralized
            server catering to multiple lightweight clients.</p>
        <p>There are lots of ways to create Java distributed applications that run on more than one JVM, and <a
                id="idp19797664"></a>Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is one of them even though it’s seldom used these
            days. For example, a client Java application (JVM1) connects to a server Java application (JVM2), which
            connects to the DBMS that runs on a third computer. The client application knows nothing about the DBMS; it
            gets the data, an <code>ArrayList</code> (or other data collection) of <code>Employee</code> objects, from
            the server’s application that runs in JVM2. RMI uses object serialization for the data exchange between JVM1
            and JVM2.</p>
        <p>But unlike with socket programming, <a id="idp19798560"></a><a id="idp19800640"></a><a id="idp19802064"></a>where
            the client simply connects to a port on the server, with RMI one Java class can <i>invoke methods</i> on
            Java objects that live in another (remote) JVM. Although from a syntax perspective it looks as if the caller
            and the server’s class are located in the same JVM, they may be thousands of miles away. The RMI client
            won’t have a copy of the server-side method; it just has the method’s local <a id="idp19803664"></a><a
                    id="idp19809728"></a><a id="idp19806000"></a><a id="idp19807328"></a>representative—a <i>proxy</i>,
            or, using the RMI terminology, a <i>stub</i>.</p>
        <p>Any RMI application consists of an RMI server, a client, and the <i>registry</i> (a naming service). These
            three components could run on three different JVMs running on different networked computers. The RMI server
            creates Java objects that implement business logic, registers them with the naming service, and waits for
            remote clients to invoke the server’s methods.</p>
        <p>A client application gets a reference to a remote server object or objects from the registry and then invokes
            methods on this remote object. RMI uses the transport layer that hides the communications between the
            client’s stub and the server-side Java objects, and even though the <a id="idp19811664"></a>methods are
            called in the client’s JVM, they are executed on the server’s. All RMI supporting classes and the registry
            tool are included with the Java SE.</p>

        <h2><a id="developing_applications_with_rmi"></a>Developing Applications with RMI</h2>
        <p>This <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="336" id="Page_336"></span>lesson is <a id="dev"></a>written as an
            illustration of a sample RMI application with a minimum theory. For a more detailed description of RMI,
            refer to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/">Oracle’s online tutorial</a> on the subject.
        </p>
        <p>Writing distributed RMI applications involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Declaring the remote interface.</li>
            <li>Implementing the remote interface.</li>
            <li>Writing a Java client that connects to the remote server and calls remote methods.</li>
            <li>Starting the registry and registering the RMI server with it. The server associates (binds) its services
                with the registry names.
            </li>
            <li>Starting the server and the client applications. The client looks up services by names and invokes
                them.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let’s perform each of these steps by developing the RMI version of the Stock Quotes Server (see its version
            with sockets in <a href="part0017.html#socket_programming">socket programming</a>), which provides a client
            with price quotes for a specified stock. Some of the preceding steps could be combined—for example, creating
            a registry and binding a service to it. The package<code> java.rmi</code> contains all RMI supporting
            classes used in the following code samples. </p>

        <h3><a id="defining_remote_interfaces"></a>Defining Remote Interfaces</h3>
        <p>The Java classes <a id="idp19826496"></a><a id="idp19827680"></a><a id="idp19829280"></a>that you are
            planning to deploy on the server side have to implement <i>remote interfaces</i>, which declare business
            method(s) to be invoked remotely by RMI clients. The client’s code looks as if it’s calling local methods,
            but these calls are redirected to a remote server via the RMI protocol. Following are the rules for creating
            remote interfaces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The remote interface must declare public methods to allow clients to perform remote method invocation.
            </li>
            <li>The remote interface must extend <code>java.rmi.Remote</code>.</li>
            <li>Each method must declare <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>.</li>
            <li>If method arguments are not primitives, they should be serializable objects to be able to travel across
                the network.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In RMI, development of a the server-side layer starts with answering the question, “What business methods
            have to be exposed to the client applications and what should their signatures be?” When you know the
            answer, define remote interfaces that declare those methods and classes that implement them. Let’s see how
            to apply this rule for the server that can serve stock prices. </p>
        <p><a id="list-anc-c024-001" href="part0025.html#list-c024-001">Listing 24-1</a> shows the code <a
                id="idp19835008"></a><a id="idp19836448"></a><a id="idp19838128"></a>of the <code>StockServer</code>
            remote interface that will be implemented on the server but <i>also must exist on the client side</i>. This
            interface declares two business methods: <code>getQuote()</code> and <code>getNasdaqSymbols()</code>. The
            first method generates a random price quote for the specified symbol, and the second returns the list of
            valid stock symbols.</p>

        In RMI, class definitions are dynamically loaded from one JVM to another. Implementation of the classes resided
        on the server side may change—for example, new methods may be introduced to the implementation of the class. But
        the client sees the stubs with only the methods defined in the interface that extends <code>Remote</code>. In
        our example, to make more server-side methods available to the RMI client, you’d need to add them to the <code>StockServer</code>
        interface and make this new version available on both the client and the server.

        <h3><a id="implementing_remote_interfaces"></a>Implementing Remote Interfaces</h3>
        <p>Although the remote <a id="idp19847600"></a><a id="idp19849296"></a><a id="idp19852256"></a>interface just
            declares the methods, you need to create a class that runs on the server side and provides implementation
            for those methods. There is a special requirement to <i>export</i> such a class to the Java RMI runtime to
            enable the class to receive remote calls. This is somewhat similar to binding to a port in the case of
            <code>ServerSocket</code> (see <a href="part0017.html#list-c016-005">Listing 16-5</a>), but in the case of
            Java RMI, the server also creates a stub—a dummy class (for the client side) that contains proxies of each
            implemented method from remote interfaces.</p>
        <p>One RMI client communicates to one server. It’s known as <i>unicast</i> as <a id="idp19855792"></a>opposed to
            <i>multicast</i> (one to many) or <i>broadcast</i> (one to all). The easiest way to export an RMI server
            instance is by extending it from <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>, as in <a
                    id="list-anc-c024-002" href="part0025.html#list-c024-002">Listing 24-2</a>. If your server has to be
            extended from another class you can explicitly export the server object by calling <code>UnicastRemoteObject.export()</code>.
        </p>
        <p><a href="part0025.html#list-c024-002">Listing 24-2</a> shows an implementation of the class <code>StockServerImpl</code>,
            which processes the client’s requests. This class generates random price quotes for the stocks located in
            <code>ArrayList nasdaqSymbols.</code></p>

                id="idp19879616"></a>two methods in the class <code>java.rmi.Naming</code> that can bind an object in
            the registry. The method <code>bind()</code> binds an RMI server to a name. It throws <code>AlreadyBoundException</code>
            if the binding already exists. The method <code>rebind()</code> replaces any possibly existing binding with
            the new one. In addition to binding a server to a name, this also ensures that the clients requesting such
            services as <code>getQuotes()</code> or <code>getNasdaqSymbols()</code> receive their stubs—the local
            proxies of the remote methods.</p>
        <p>The registry must be up and running by the time you start the program in <a
                href="part0025.html#list-c024-003">Listing 24-3</a>. One way to start the registry is by entering <code>start
            rmiregistry</code> in the Windows command window or <code>rmiregistry</code> in Mac OS. Instead of starting
            the registry manually, you can start it from within the <code>StartServer</code> program itself by calling
            the following method:</p>
        <pre>
LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);</pre>
        <p>If you know that another process has already pre-created the registry, just get its reference and bind the
            server to it. The <code>getRegistry()</code> method can be called without arguments if the RMI registry runs
            on the default port 1099. If this is not the case, specify the port number (5048 in the following example).
            The variable <code>registry</code> in the following code fragment is a stub to the remote object <code>StockServerImpl</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
StockServerImpl ssi = new StockServerImpl();
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(5048);
registry.bind("QuoteService", ssi);</pre>

            code can perform on the local computer? Can the server restrict access? You can specify a security policy
            file containing access restrictions. For example, in the code in <a href="part0025.html#list-c024-003">Listing
                24-3</a> and <a href="part0025.html#list-c024-004">Listing 24-4</a> you can start the
            <code>main()</code> method with the following code:</p>
        <pre>
if (System.getSecurityManager() == null) {
       System.setSecurityManager(new RMISecurityManager());
 }</pre>
        <p>The class <code>java.rmi.RMISecurityManager</code> extends the class <code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code>
            and provides a security context under which the RMI application executes. In RMI clients, the goal is to
            prevent remotely loaded stub code from downloading unsecured code via remote method invocation.</p>
        <p>The RMI client uses a file in which security policies are defined. You can use the default security file,
            <code>java.policy</code>, located in your JDK or JRE installation directory under <code>lib/security</code>.
            The default policy file gives all permissions to the code, but you can create your own file and supply it
            either via the command-line parameter or in the code before the security manager is set:</p>
        <pre>
System.setProperty("java.security.policy", "mypolicyfile");</pre>
        <p>For <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="341" id="Page_341"></span>a more detailed description of security
            policy files, refer to the documentation at <code><a
                    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html</a></code>.
        </p>
        <p>Java applets <a id="idp19919072"></a><a id="idp19920944"></a><a id="idp19922576"></a>can also serve as RMI
            clients, but they don’t need RMI security managers. The only restriction on them is that they can connect
            only to the RMI server running on the same host on which they were deployed.</p>

        <h3><a id="finding_remote_objects"></a>Finding Remote Objects</h3>
        <p>RMI clients find <a id="idp19924608"></a><a id="idp19926336"></a><a id="idp19929280"></a><a
                id="idp19930432"></a>remote services by using a <i>naming</i> or <i>directory service</i>. A naming
            service runs on a known host and port number. The subject of naming and directory services is covered in
            more detail in <a href="part0030.html#introducing_jndi">Chapter 29</a>.</p>
        <p>By now you know that an RMI server can start its own registry that offers naming services for RMI clients.
            The behavior of the registry is defined by the interface <code>java.rmi.registry.Registry</code>, and you
            saw an example of binding to the registry in the section <a href="part0025.html#registering_remote_objects">“Registering
                Remote Objects”</a>.</p>
        <p>By default, the RMI registry runs on port 1099, unless another port number is specified. When the client
            wants to invoke methods on a remote object it obtains a reference to that object by looking up the name. The
            lookup returns to the client a remote reference, also known as a <i>stub</i>.</p>
        <p>The method <code>lookup()</code> takes the object name’s URL as an argument in the following format:</p>
        <pre>
rmi://&lt;host_name&gt;[:&lt;name_service_port&gt;]/&lt;service_name&gt;</pre>
        <p><code>host_name</code> stands for the name of a computer on the local area network (LAN), or the name of a
            domain name system (DNS) on the Internet. <code>name_service_port</code> has to be specified only if the
            naming service is running on a port other than the default. <code>service_name</code> stands for the name of
            the remote object that should be bound to the registry.</p>
        <p><a id="fig-anc-c024-001" href="part0025.html#fig-c024-001">Figure 24-1</a> illustrates the architecture of an
            RMI application. In the “Try It,” section you implement this architecture for the <a id="idp19939328"></a>sample
            stock quote service.</p>

        <p>In this exercise your goal is <a id="idp19948144"></a><a id="idp19949488"></a>to start and test all the parts
            of the distributed Stock Server application, and you run all these parts on the same computer. The <code>StartServer</code>
            program creates a registry and binds the <code>StockServerImpl</code> under the name <i>QuoteService</i>. To
            emulate multiple computers you start the client from a command window. If everything is done properly you
            should be able to start the RMI client with one of the stock symbols known to the server, and get a price
            quote back.</p>

            <h3><a id="hints-id00091"></a>Hints</h3>
            <p>There is an RMI plug-in for the Eclipse RMI that may be handy for developing RMI-based distributed
                applications. It contains a useful utility called RMI Spy that shows all outgoing and incoming method
                calls, and measures execution times. Another useful utility in this plug-in is Registry Inspector, which
                displays information about objects in the registry. The RMI plug-in is available from <code>www.genady.net/rmi/index.html</code>.

            <h3><a id="step-by-step-id00092"></a>Step-by-Step</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Import the Eclipse project called Lesson24. It has two packages: <code>client</code> and <code>server</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Rebuild the project (use the menu Project → Clean). Note the location of the Eclipse workspace; you
                    need it because you run all code samples from command windows. Make sure that after importing the
                    project it points at the JRE that’s installed on your compute (right-click on the project name and
                    use the menu Properties → Java Build Path).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Run the program <code>StartServer</code> to start and register <code>StockServer</code> with the
                        registry (note the creation of registry with <code>LocateRegistry</code> ). After you enter a
                        command similar to the one shown below, the server starts and binds to the registry, printing
                        the following message in the Eclipse console:</p>
                    <pre>
&lt;QuoteService&gt; server is ready.</pre>
                    The server stays up and running waiting for requests from the clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can run the client from Eclipse, too, but to better illustrate the fact that you use
                        different JVMs, run the client from a command window. Open a command (or Terminal) window and go
                        to the <code>bin</code> directory of the project Lesson24 in your Eclipse workspace. On my
                        computer I did it as follows:</p>
                    <p><code>cd /Users/yfain11/practicalJava/workspace/Lesson24/bin</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Run the <code>Client</code> program located in the <code>client</code> package, passing the stock
                        symbol as a command-line argument, and the <code>Client</code> connects to your “remote” server
                        and receives the price quote—for example:</p>
                    <pre>
java client.Client AAPL</pre>
                    On my computer the output looked as follows:
                    <p><code>The price of AAPL is: $91.85776369781252</code></p>
                </li>
                <li>Open several command windows and run the client program in each of them, emulating multiple clients
                    sending requests to the same server.
                </li>
                <li>Add <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="343" id="Page_343"></span>the following statement to the
                    method <code>getQuote()</code> of <code>StockServerImpl</code> class and note how the server reports
                    each quote request in the Eclipse console:
                    <p><code>System.out.println("Got the price quote request for " +<br/>
                                                                        symbol);</code></p>
                </li>
            </ol>
