<p>First <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xi" id="Page_xi"></span>of all I want to thank my family for understanding that stealing (once again) time from family to write a computer book is OK.</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank the technical editors, Rajesuwer P. Singaravelu and Martijn Verberg, for their valuable input.</p>
<p>My special thanks to Chad Darby for producing the awesome videos for this book.  </p>
<p>I give particular thanks to my business partners and colleagues at Farata Systems. They didn’t contribute to this book directly, but working in the same team with these top notch professionals makes me a better programmer day in and day out.  </p>
<p>Big thanks to the Wiley editors for doing a great job of editing and for not cursing me for not meeting deadlines.</p>
