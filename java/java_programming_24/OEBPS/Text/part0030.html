        <p>Instead <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="413" id="Page_413"></span>of having distributed Java programs that
            instantiate lots of reusable objects over and over again, it’s better if these objects are pre-created and
            published at a known server, where they can be easily and quickly found. <a
                    href="part0025.html#remote_method_invocation">Lesson 24</a> introduces a registry concept, in which
            a Java object can be published under some name so the client can look it up.  </p>
        <p>Java Naming <a id="idp21348288"></a><a id="idp21349328"></a>and Directory Interface (JNDI) is also about
            registering and finding objects in distributed applications. JNDI is an application programming interface
            (API) that can be used for binding and accessing objects located in Java EE or specialized naming servers
            that play roles  similar to that of a company telephone directory assistance service. But instead of looking
            for people’s information, you look for objects. Various software vendors offer specialized directory
            assistance software, and JNDI provides a standard API to read from and write to such directories. </p>
        <p>Every Java EE application server comes with an administrator’s console that allows you to manage objects in a
            JNDI tree. This lesson introduces you to the JNDI concepts, and you see how to use JNDI for <a
                    id="idp21359456"></a><a id="idp21360464"></a>publishing (and looking up) <i>administered objects</i>
            (that is, configured by the server administrator).  Some examples of administered objects are database
            connection pools and message queues (explained in <a href="part0031.html#introducing_jms_and_mom">Lesson
                30</a>). </p>

        <h2><a id="java_naming_and_directory_interface"></a>Naming and Directory Services</h2>
        <p>A <i>naming service</i> enables <a id="idp21356288"></a><a id="idp21357552"></a>you to add, change, or delete
            names of objects that exist in some naming hierarchy so other Java classes can look them up to find their
            location. One more analogy: In a library, you find the name of the physical location of the book in a
            directory and then go to the shelf to pick up the book. A naming service provides a unique name for every
            entry that is registered with (<i>bound to</i>) this service. Every naming service <a
                    id="idp21361344"></a><a id="idp21362880"></a>has one or more <i>contexts</i>—think of directories
            and subdirectories in a file system, where any directory tree with children is a context. The naming tree
            originates from a root node, which is also known as an <i>initial context</i> (like a root directory on the
            disk).</p>
        <p>A <i>directory <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="414" id="Page_414"></span>service</i> enables you to search
            the naming tree by object attributes rather than object names. One example is that of the domain name
            system, which is a distributed naming system that takes the domain name of a networked computer or service
            and returns the IP address and port number of the resource.</p>
        <p>To allow clients to do lookups, there has to be a process that initially binds the objects to a naming tree.
            This can be handled via a sever administration console or an independent program that (for example) binds
            employee names to a directory server of some organization. Java EE servers bind such objects as EJB,
            Servlets, JMS, and database connection pools to their naming servers during startup.</p>
        <p>All classes and interfaces that support JNDI are located in the package <code>javax.naming</code> that comes
            with Java EE SDK.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2><a id="idp21366304"></a>Using the Class InitialContext </h2>
        <p>The class <code>InitialContext</code> represents <a id="idp21373200"></a><a id="idp21368768"></a><a
                id="idp21370016"></a>the root of a JNDI tree in a naming server. There are two ways of getting a
            reference to  a particular resource that was bound to this tree:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your Java code runs inside Java EE server, it can can <i>inject</i> the JNDI resource into your
                program by using <code>@Resource</code> annotation. Your program can also run a <code>lookup()</code> on
                the <code>InitialContext</code> object.
            </li>
            <li>If an external Java program needs a JNDI resource (for example, a standalone messaging program needs to
                get references to the message queues bound to the JNDI tree of an application server), it has to get a
                reference to the <code>InitialContext</code> and then invoke the method <code>lookup()</code> .
            </li>
        </ul>
        <section>
            <h3><a id="initial_context"></a>Getting a Reference to InitialContext</h3>
            <p>Explicit instantiation of <code>InitialContext</code> is needed only if you are planning to use <code>lookup()</code>
                as opposed to resource injection, which is explained in the next section. If a Java program runs inside
                the application server, instantiating the <code>InitialContext</code> object comes down to one line of
                code:</p>
            <pre>
Context initContext = new InitialContext();
</pre>
            <p>If a Java program runs outside of the application server, you need to specify the location of the server,
                the names of the vendor-specific classes implementing <code>InitialContext</code>, and the access
                credentials. For example, for the WildFly application server, the following code may be used (given that
                you know the security credentials):</p>
            <pre>
final Properties env = new Properties(); 
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,
        "org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory"); 
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, “http-remoting://127.0.0.1:8080"); 
env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, “Alex123”); 
env.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, “MySecretPwd”;
 
Context initContext = new InitialContext(env);
</pre>
            <p>If an external program needs to access the <code>InitialContext</code> object in the GlassFish server,
                the code may look like this:</p>
            <pre>
final Properties env = new Properties(); 
env.setProperty("java.naming.factory.initial",
           "com.sun.enterprise.naming.SerialInitContextFactory"); 
env.setProperty("java.naming.factory.url.pkgs",
           "com.sun.enterprise.naming"); 
env.setProperty("java.naming.factory.state", 
    "com.sun.corba.ee.impl.presentation.rmi.JNDIStateFactoryImpl"); 
env.setProperty("org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost", "localhost"); 
env.setProperty("org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort", "8080"); 
InitialContext initContext = new InitialContext(env);
</pre>
            <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="415" id="Page_415"></span>You need to read the documentation that
                comes with your application server to get the proper code for accessing JNDI from an external program.
                  </p>
            <p>After receiving a reference to <code>InitialContext</code>, you can invoke a <code>lookup()</code> method
                specifying the name of the required resource. <a href="part0031.html#introducing_jms_and_mom">Lesson
                    30</a> explains Java messaging in detail, but for now I’ll just show you an example of getting a
                reference to a message queue named <code>test</code>:</p>
            <pre>
Destination destination = (Destination)
                     initContext.lookup(“jms/queue/test");
</pre>
            <p> The next code samples show how to get a reference to an EJB and a default JDBC data source:</p>
            <pre>
MySessionBean msb = (MySessionBean) initContext.lookup(
                                 "java:comp/env/ejb/mySessionBean");
 
DataSource ds = (DataSource) initContext.lookup(
                           "java:comp/env/jdbc/DefaultDataSource");</pre>
            <p>The next section shows you an example of preferable way of getting JNDI resources by injection.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a id="resource_injection"></a>Injecting JNDI Resources</h3>
            <p>Most likely, your Java programs <a id="idp21396848"></a>that need JNDI resources will run inside some
                Java EE application server, which greatly simplifies getting a hold of such resources. In this case you
                don’t even need to instantiate <code>InitialContext</code> or invoke <code>lookup()</code>. </p>
            <p>Resource injection <a id="idp21399344"></a><a id="idp21400864"></a>with the
                annotation <code>@Resource</code> is a cleaner and simpler way of providing these resources to your Java
                EE components. In <a href="part0031.html#introducing_jms_and_mom">Lesson 30</a> you use resource for
                getting references to JMS objects, which look as follows:</p>
            <pre>
import javax.annotation.Resource;
...
@Resource(name="MyTestConnectionFactory")
private ConnectionFactory factory;
@Resource(name="MyJMSTestQueue")
private Queue ioQueue;</pre>
            <p>For <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="416" id="Page_416"></span>example, you could place this code in a
                Java servlet, which sends messages to a <code>Queue</code> bound to the JNDI tree under the name <code>MyJMSTestQueue</code> with
                the help of the <code>ConnectionFactory</code> that has the JNDI name
                <code>MyTestConnectionFactory</code>.  These resources are injected into variables <code>ioQueue</code>
                and <code>factory</code> by the servlet container—no need to do a lookup.  </p>
            <p>Depending on its location, the time of injection varies. If you put the <code>@Resource</code> annotation
                at the class level, the resource is injected during run time when the application looks it up. If you
                put this annotation above the field or setter method declaration, the resource is injected in the
                component when the application is initialized.</p>
            <p>If you need to override resources specified in annotations, you can do it in XML configuration files. You
                see more examples of using resource injection with EJB in <a
                        href="part0032.html#introduction_to_enterprise_javabeans">Chapter 31</a>. Later in this lesson
                you use resource injection of JDBC <code>DataSource</code>. Meanwhile, take a look at the GlassFish
                Administration Console.</p>

        <p>Typically the administrator of the Java EE server pre-creates the pools of database connections and

        <p>The Java program that needs a JDBC connection gets access to the connection pool by its JNDI name (<code>DerbyPool</code>
            in this case) and makes a <code>getConnection()</code> call on this resource. If unused connections are
            available, the Java class immediately gets an instance of the <code>Connection</code> object that internally
            implements <code>PooledConnection. </code>If many users are making concurrent requests, all connections may
            be taken, and there is a slight delay until one of the busy connections is returned to the pool. Connection
            is auto-closable, and it gets returned to the pool on closing. Connections returned to the pool are not
            destroyed; they are preserved by the application server for future requests.</p>
        <p>You can do either a JNDI lookup of the <code>DataSource</code> object or inject it to your Java code. In <a
                href="part0022.html#working_with_databases_using_jdbc">Lesson 21</a> you’ve been using a standalone Java
            program, which invoked <code>DriverManager.getConnection()</code> to get the <code>Connection</code> object.
            But now you can use <code>getConnection()</code> on the <code>DataSource</code> object taken from the
            pool. If the name of the configured <code>DataSource</code> object is <code>DerbyPool</code>, the sample
            code to obtain a pooled database connection may look as follows:</p>
        <pre>
InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
DataSource ds = (DataSource) ic.lookup("DerbyPool");
Connection myConnection = ds.getConnection();
//The rest of the JDBC processing goes here as in <a href="part0022.html">Lesson 21</a>
</pre>
        <p>Injecting a <code>DataSource</code> using the <code>@Resource</code> syntax would  look like this:</p>
        <pre>
@Resource(name="java:global/DerbyPool")
DataSource ds;</pre>

        <h2><a id="lightweight_directory_access_protocol"></a>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</h2>
        <p>Lightweight Directory <a id="light"></a>Access Protocol (LDAP) servers are specialized software products that
            store directory entries in hierarchical trees and are highly optimized for reading. This makes them a good
            choice for such directory services as employee lists or phone directories in an organization. Directories
            are mainly read, not changed, and this is where LDAP servers shine.</p>
        <p>From the enterprise Java perspective you should keep LDAP solutions in mind when a really fast lookup of some
            Java objects is needed, such as with JMS connection factories, queues, or topics. Java developers use the
            JNDI API to bind, look up, and update the entries in LDAP. JNDI is to LDAP servers as JDBC is to DBMSes.</p>
        <p>These are some popular LDAP servers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oracle Directory Server (Oracle)</li>
            <li>Microsoft Active Directory (Microsoft)</li>
            <li>OpenLDAP (open-source, community developed)</li>
            <li>ApacheDS (open-source, Apache)</li>

        <p>The LDAP directory tree has a root entry, which consists of one or more  <i>distinguished names</i> (unique
            identifiers). Typically the top of the hierarchy is an object with the prefix <i>o</i> for
            <i>organization</i>. One level below has the prefix <i>ou</i> for <i>organizational unit</i>, <i>cn</i>
            stands for <i>common name</i>, and so on. Unlike with other naming services, the search string starts from
            the very lowest hierarchical entry and the root entry has to be specified last. Here’s an example of a
            distinguished name that can be used in a search:</p>
        <pre>
cn=jsmith, ou=accounting, o=oracle.com</pre>
        <p>This means “Find the entry that goes by the name jsmith located under accounting node, which in turn is
            located under oracle.com." The preceding search string corresponds to the following hierarchy in an LDAP
            tree:</p>
        <pre>
o = oracle.com
  ou = accounting
     cn = jsmith</pre>
        <p>The next Java code snippet specifies the JNDI properties, connects to the LDAP server running on port 389,
            and looks for the object called <code>CustomerHome</code>there: </p>
        <pre>
Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt; env = new Hashtable&lt;&gt;();
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,
                        "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "ldap://localhost:389");
env.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION,"simple");
env.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, "cn=Directory Manager");
env.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS,"myPassword");
DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext(env);
CustomerHome custHome =(CustomerHome) ctx.lookup("cn=CusomerHome,
ou=RealBigProject, o=trump.com");</pre>
        <p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="420" id="Page_420"></span>To study distributed applications you can run
            all the examples from this book (clients and servers) on a single computer, but real-world distributed
            applications can be constructed in various ways; for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer #1 runs the LDAP server.</li>
            <li>Computer #2 runs an application server that has registered (published) some objects with the LDAP server
                on Computer #1.
            </li>
            <li>Computer #3 has a client program that finds object references on Computer #1 and invokes their methods
                on Computer #2.
            </li>
            <li>Computer #4 runs a DBMS server that is being used by the application server running on Computer #2.</li>
            <li>Computer #5 publishes financial market data, and Computer #2 subscribes to this service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...and so on, and so on.</p>

                <p>When the terrorists attacked and destroyed the World Trade Center, I was working for a firm that lost
                    the data center as a result of this attack. I was working on a financial trading application that
                    utilized messaging. The JMS objects that were using New York’s data center were bound to an LDAP
                    server located in North Carolina. When the reserved data center started functioning in New Jersey,
                    we just ran the program to rebind the JMS objects to the LDAP server so they would point at the
                    messaging server in a new location. Because of such a flexible architecture, the firm’s trading
                    application was not operational for only three days.</p>

        <p>This lesson has shown you how to use JNDI and given some examples of why you may want to use it. Comparing
            the code in <a href="part0031.html#list-c030-001">Listing 30-1</a> with the one in messageservlet is just
            one example that shows that naming and binding specific physical objects under a generic JNDI name enables
            you to remove these physical locations from your program code. <a

            <ol>
                <li>Open the command (or Terminal ) window, switch to the folder <code>glassfish/javadb/bin</code> and
                    start the instance of the DerbyDB that comes with GlassFish. You need to run <code>startNetworkServer.exe</code>
                    (or  <code>startNetworkServer</code> if you use  Mac OS).
                </li>
                <li>Start GlassFish from the Eclipse IDE.</li>
                <li>In Eclipse, create a new Dynamic Web Project Lesson29 specifying GlassFish as the target run
                    time. 
                </li>
                <li>Create a new servlet called <code>MyDerbyClientServlet</code>. This servlet should get the <code>DataSource</code>
                    injected and use it for a connection to DerbyDB. Modify the generated code so the servlet looks as
                    follows:
                    <pre>
@WebServlet("/MyDerbyClientServlet")
public class MyDerbyClientServlet extends HttpServlet {
  @Resource(name="java:global/DerbyPool")
  DataSource ds; 
  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response) 
                        throws ServletException, IOException {
		
     try {
         Connection myPooledConnection = ds.getConnection();
	 System.out.println("Got pooled connection to DerbyDB");
			
     } catch (SQLException e) {
	  e.printStackTrace();
     }
  }
}
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Deploy <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="422" id="Page_422"></span>the servlet: Right-click
                    GlassFish in the Server view and select Add and Remove. Check the Eclipse console and locate the
                    message that the Lesson29 application is loaded.
                </li>
                <li>Right-click the servlet name and select Run on Server. You should see the message “Got pooled
                    connection to DerbyDB” in the Console view.
                </li>
                <li>Open GlassFish Administration Console and go to the Additional Properties tab of DerbyPool. Modify
                    the database name to be Lesson29.
