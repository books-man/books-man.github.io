<p class="ChapterTitle">Acknowledgments</p>
<p class="noindent">The acknowledgements are probably the hardest thing to write. It is impossible to name everyone personally and I probably will forget someone. For that I want to apologize beforehand.</p>
<p class="indent">Although this is the second book I wrote I couldn’t have done it without the team at Apress; without you this book would have never seen the light of day. A special thanks to Mark Powers and Anamika Panchoo for keeping me focused and on schedule.</p>
<p class="indent">I thank <b class="calibre4">Felipe Gutierrez</b>, without whose comments and suggestions this book would never have become what it is now.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks to my family and friends for the times they missed me, and to my dive-buddies for all the dives and trips I missed over the last year.</p>
<p class="indent">Last but definitely not least I thank my wife, Djoke Deinum, and daughter, Geeske, for their endless support, love, and dedication, despite the long evenings, sacrificed weekends and holidays to finish the book. Without your support I probably would have abandoned the endeavor long ago.</p>
