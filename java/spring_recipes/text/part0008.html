<p class="ChapterTitle">Introduction</p>
<p class="noindent">The Spring framework is growing. It has always been about choice. Java EE focused on a few technologies, largely to the detriment of alternative, better solutions. When the Spring framework debuted, few would have agreed that Java EE represented the best-in-breed architectures of the day. Spring debuted to great fanfare, because it sought to simplify Java EE. Each release since marks the introduction of new features designed to both simplify and enable solutions.</p>
<p class="indent">With version 2.0 and later, the Spring framework started targeting multiple platforms. The framework provided services on top of existing platforms, as always, but was decoupled from the underlying platform wherever possible. Java EE is a still a major reference point, but it’s not the only target. Additionally, the Spring framework runs on different Cloud environments. With the introduction of Java based configuration and more XML schemas, the Spring framework created powerful configuration options. Frameworks built on top of the Spring framework have emerged supporting application integration, batch processing, messaging, and much more.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the 3<sup class="calibre9">rd</sup> edition of the superb Spring Recipes and it contains mostly updated frameworks, describing the new features and explaining the different configuration (Java and/or XML) options. Additionally, new projects have been added to the Spring ecosystem like the Spring Data family of products.</p>
<p class="indent">It was impossible to describe each and every project in the Spring ecosystem, so we had to decide what to keep, what to add, and what to update. This was a hard decision but we think we have included the most important and used content.</p>
<p id="Sec1" class="Heading">Who This Book Is For</p>
<p class="noindent">This book is for Java developers who want to simplify their architecture and solve problems outside the scope of the Java EE platform. If you are already using Spring in your projects, the more advanced chapters present discussions of newer technologies that you might not know about already. If you are new to the framework, this book will get you started in no time.</p>
<p class="indent">This book assumes that you have some familiarity with Java and an IDE of some sort. While it is possible, and indeed useful, to use Java exclusively with client applications, Java’s largest community lives in the enterprise space and that, too, is where you’ll see most of these technologies deliver the most benefit. Thus, some familiarity with basic enterprise programming concepts like the Servlet API is assumed.</p>

<p id="Sec3" class="Heading">Conventions</p>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, when we want you to pay particular attention to a part within a code example, we will make the font bold. Please note that the bold doesn’t necessarily reflect a code change from the previous version.</p>
<p class="indent">In cases when a code line is too long to fit the page’s width, we will break it with a code continuation character. Please note that when you try to type the code, you have to concatenate the line by yourself without any spaces.</p>
<p id="Sec4" class="Heading">Prerequisites</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the Java programming language is platform independent, you are free to choose any supported operating system. However, some of the examples in this book use platform-specific paths. Translate them as necessary to your operating system’s format before typing the examples.</p>
<p class="indent">To make the most of this book, install JDK version 1.7 or higher. You should have a Java IDE installed to make development easier. For this book, the sample code is Gradle based. If you’re running Eclipse and Install the Gradle plug-in, you can open the same code in Eclipse and the CLASSPATH and dependencies will be filled in the by the Gradle metadata.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re using Eclipse, you might prefer SpringSource’s SpringSource Tool Suite (STS), as it comes preloaded with the plug-ins you’ll need to be productive with the Spring framework in Eclipse. If you use IntelliJ IDEA, you need to enable the Gradle (and Groovy) plugins.</p>
